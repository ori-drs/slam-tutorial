## Installation

Use a virtual environment (`env` in the example), isolated from the system dependencies:

```sh
python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install the automatic formatting pre-commit hooks (black and flake8), which will check the code before each commit:

```sh
pre-commit install
```
